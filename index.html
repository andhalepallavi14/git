                                <li>Bhatura ingredients: Flour, baking powder, baking soda, yogurt, salt, sugar, and water 
                                    Chole ingredients: Spicy white chickpeas, also known as chana masala 
                                    </li>
                                <li>Make the bhatura dough
                                    Sift together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Add the yogurt, salt, and sugar, and mix well. Gradually add water until the ingredients form a dough. Knead the dough for 2â€“3 minutes. Rub some oil on the dough, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest for 30 minutes</li>
                                <li>Deep fry the bhatura
                                    Heat oil in a kadai or wok over medium-high heat. Divide the dough into 8â€“10 balls, then flatten each ball into a thin, round disc. Add the dough to the hot oil. Once the bottom is cooked, flip the dough over. When both sides are cooked, remove the bhatura from the oil and place it on a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining dough</li>
                                <li> Serve
                                    Chole bhature is often eaten for breakfast and goes well with lassi. You can also serve it with a green chutney made from fresh cilantro, mint, green chili, ginger, and lemon juice. Raita, a yogurt-based dip, can help balance out the spiciness</li>
